            <p>Alash Orda, the Kazakh democratic movement, was founded by Alikhan Bukeikhanov in 1917. The movement
                aimed to establish Kazakh autonomy within Russia.</p>
            <img src="alas1.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Led by prominent Kazakh intellectuals such as Alikhan Bokeikhan, Akhmet Baitursynuly, and Mirzhakyp
                Dulatov, among others, the movement called for the recognition of Kazakh autonomy, the preservation of
                Kazakh culture and language, leading to profound social, cultural, and economic transformations.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The first All-Kirgiz (Kazakh) Congress was held in Orenburg on July 21-28 in 1917 with the establishment
                of the Alash party, the body that established Kazakhstan’s autonomy. The framing of an autonomous Kazakh
                government has been an ongoing process. The 1917 February revolution and the abdication of Tsar Nicholas
                II accelerated the political unity of various layers of Kazakh society. The hopes of Alash intellectuals
                for liberation from colonial rule strengthened, and they started taking steps toward creating autonomy.
                During the same congress, pivotal resolutions were reached on many matters, including the formation of a
                political party, land management, the formation of militia (police), court, educational issues and the
                status of Kazakh women, among others. The main resolution of the congress was to defend the right of
                Kazakhs to territorial and national autonomy within the democratic, parliamentary and federal Russian
                Republic. Bokeikhan was elected the chairman of the Alash party. The Kazakh newspaper was recognized as
                the official publication.</p>
            <img src="3(100).jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>In his congratulatory speech, President Tokayev highlighted the role of Bokeikhan in ​​Kazakhstan’s path
                to nationhood. “Alikhan Bokeikhan said that the way to freedom lies only through the unity of the
                nation. The statesmen of our country have shown loyalty to this admonition of the great son of our
                nation. Having united at a crucial moment, they were able to defend national interests,” said Tokayev.
                “The fateful document [Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Kazakh SSR] corresponded to the
                aspirations and expectations of the people and was adopted thanks to the wisdom and prudence of the
                patriots of the country. Their courage and determination at a critical hour can be regarded as genuine
                heroism,” he added.</p>
            <img src="kz1-2119-2-2_1-2048x1318.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Alash Orda faced opposition from the Bolsheviks, who were consolidating power after the Russian
                Revolution and opposed nationalist movements. The Bolsheviks, committed to the idea of a unified Soviet
                state, saw nationalist groups like Alash Orda as a threat to their vision of proletarian unity.
                Consequently, they launched a campaign to suppress these movements, often through military force and
                political repression. Alash Orda, representing the interests and autonomy of the Kazakh people, found
                itself in a precarious position, having to navigate between asserting its nationalist goals and facing
                the overwhelming might of the Bolshevik regime. This conflict was emblematic of the larger struggles
                occurring across the former Russian Empire, where various ethnic and national groups sought to assert
                their independence in the chaotic aftermath of the revolution and the collapse of the tsarist regime.
                The Bolsheviks' approach to these movements was often ruthless, as they prioritized the establishment of
                a centralized, communist state over the aspirations of individual ethnic or national entities.</p>
